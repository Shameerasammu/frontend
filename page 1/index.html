    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>At Madras Filter Coffee, we serve authentic South Indian brews with a modern twist.
      tory began in the 17th century when Sufi saint Baba Budan reputedly smuggled seven coffee beans from Yemen and planted them in the Chikmagalur district of Karnataka, laying the foundation for India's first coffee plantations. Coffee cultivation was later encouraged by the British in the 18th century, with widespread commercialization leading to its integration into South Indian culture. The traditional South Indian filter coffee, or kaapi, uses a metal filter and a mixture of dark-roasted coffee and chicory, a blend that became popular due to its strong aroma and robust taste.

         <p style= "font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">In 2011, Coffea absorbed the twenty species of Coffea are still being identified in the 2000s. In 2008 and 2009, researchers from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, named seven from the mountains of northern Madagascar, including C. ambongensis, C. boinensis, C. labatii, C. pterocarpa, C. bissetiae, and C. namorokensis.[18]
In 2008, two new species were discovered in Cameroon: Coffea charrieriana, which is caffeine-free, and Coffea anthonyi.By crossing the new species with other known coffees, two new features might be introduced to cultivated coffee plants: beans without caffeine and self-pollination
In 2011, Coffea absorbed the twenty species of the former genus Psilanthus due to the morphological and genetic similarities between the two genera.[20] Historically, the two have been considered distinct genera due to differences in the length of the corolla tube and the anther arrangement: Coffea with a short corolla tube and exserted style and anthers; Psilanthus with a long corolla tube and included anthers. However, these characteristics were not present in all species of either respective genus, making the two genera overwhelmingly similar in both morphology and genetic sequence. This transfer expanded Coffea from 104 species to 124, and extended its native distribution to tropical Asia and Australasia.
The coffee genome was published in 2014, with more than 25,000 genes identified. This revealed that coffee plants make caffeine using a different set of genes from those found in tea, cacao and other such plants.[21]
A robust and almost fully resolved phylogeny of the entire genus was published in 2017.[12] In addition to resolving the relationships of Coffea species, this study's results suggest Africa or Asia as the likely ancestral origin of Coffea and point to several independent radiations across Africa, Asia, and the Western Indian Ocean Islands.
In 2020, a technique of DNA fingerprinting, or genetic authentication of plant material, was proven effective for coffee.For the study, scientists used DNA extraction and SSR marker analysis. This technique or similar ones may allow for several improvements to coffee production such as improved information for farmers as to the susceptibility of their coffee plants to pests and disease, a professionalized coffee seed system, and transparency and traceability for buyers of green, un-roasted coffee.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="p1 fade-in">
<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5">There are over 130 species of Coffea, which is grown from seed. The two most popular are Coffea arabica (commonly known simply as "Arabica"), which accounts for 60–80% of the world's coffee production, and Coffea canephora (known as "Robusta"), which accounts for about 20–40%.[2][3] C. arabica is preferred for its sweeter taste, while C. canephora has a higher caffeine content. C. arabica has its origins in the highlands of Ethiopia and the Boma Plateau of Sudan, and came about as the result of a hybrid between C. canephora and C. eugenioides.[7]
The trees produce edible red or purple fruits that are either epigynous berries or indehiscent drupes.[8] The fruit is often referred to as a "coffee cherry", and it contains two seeds, called "coffee beans".[9] Despite these terms, coffee is neither a true cherry (the fruit of certain species in the genus Prunus) nor a true bean (seeds from plants in the family Fabaceae).
In any coffee crop, about 5–10% of fruits contain only a single bean. Called a peaberry, it is smaller and rounder than a normal coffee bean.
When grown in the tropics, coffee is a vigorous bush or small tree that usually grows to a height of 3.5 m (10–11+1⁄2 ft). Most commonly cultivated coffee species grow best at high elevations, but do not tolerate freezing temperatures.[10]
The Coffea arabica tree grows fruit after three to five years, producing for an average of 50 to 60 years, though up to 100 years is possible.[11] The white flowers are highly scented. The fruit takes about nine months to ripen</p>
